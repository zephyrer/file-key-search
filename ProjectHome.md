### About ###
> This Programm provides ability to search the target file for the embedded files by
> the specific format parameters predefined as "Keys" disregarding the rules of such file packaging.

> Each Key represents minimum file format specification that allows to distinguish it from
> other file formats during the Search.

> It is suitable to find and extract recognized items (Media) in a file that is known to combine other file-types
> inside. For example that may be a raw uncompressed hard-disk/memory dump (image) or a data-file that accumulates other
> resources that are used (indirectly) by the data-file owner programm.

### Requirements ###
  * Operating System: Win 2000 or later; Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE) with `"wine"` 1.0 or later.
  * Optionally: Hex Viewer/Editor in order to find and use File Signature to create a search-key ([HxD](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) for example).

### Installation ###
  1. Extract the archive to the location of your will, for example "`C:\Program Files\FileKeySearch\`";
  1. To load a preset of keys that comes whith the programm archive:
> execute `FileKeySearch.exe` then select from main menu: `Keys->Import from File...->Open File..`;
> Browse for "`C:\Program Files\FileKeySearch\FileKeySearch.Keys.REG`"; click `Import` and `Close`.
> Following file signatures will be imported into the Registry:
  * RAR, ZIP, ELF, MZ, HTML, XML, PDF, BMP, JFiF, EXIF, GIF, JNG, MNG, PNG, MP3, OggS, BiK, FLV, RiFF (wav/avi)
> You can add more keys later in `Keys->Keys Manager` and even export to .REG file for a backup/sharing purposes.
> Furthermore, this site may come in help if youre looking for a rare/new signature definition: [File Signatures Table](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html)

### Usage ###
> To start file analysis choose `File->New`, then `Browse` for the target file or drag-in that file with your mouse,
> after clicking `Next` select which Keys you want to be used during the search`*`, proceed to the `Finish` to start
> analysis. After analysis, programm will display Local Key tree on the left pane and table of found Media items
> on the right pane (if any was found). Click on some key under `Total Found` tree-root to see found items under that key.
> To extract found media select them and choose Extract from the right-click-menu.
> You can save search results with Local Keys and all metadata about found items in a file with ```*`.FileKeySearch`` extension.

> `*` Note that keys used for analyze once they selected called "Local Keys" become logically separated from the
> programm keys called "Global Keys", and can be changed by double clicking on any key in a key-tree.

### Uninstall ###
> To uninstall simply remove programm's folder, then run "`regedit.exe`" and remove this key that stores file signature metadata:
> `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Noosphere\FileKeySearch`
